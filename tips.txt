//2
  //rat = tar
  //aaz = aza
  //qwerty = ytrewq

  // roof = oofr

  // Create an object to hold the character count of each string
  //Add the characters from the strings to the objects
  //Compare the objects
    //if keys of each object the same
      //compare character counts
    //if keys don't match return false
    //if we never return false, return true
